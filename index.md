# Series Overview

In this lecture series we will create a space for new interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary conversations and collaborations across the STEM/Humanities divide in service of an antiracist future by hosting a series of Black scholars who experiment with bridging this gulf in their own work.  Through four invited speaker visits, the URI community at large will learn from individual scholars who incorporate the humanities into their STEM scholarship or who examine STEM with a humanist lens. Each talk will illustrate specific scholarly techniques, experiences, and findings that exemplify the need for an interdisciplinary approach to the challenge of racism and the radical possibilities that can stem from integrating these traditionally incongruous approaches.

Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) and Social Justice issues are often
considered disparate if not opposing centers of work for academic and professional pursuits.
Students and professionals are typically expected to choose STEM or the social sciences, arts
and humanities as separate and distinct categories of work that are difficult to intermingle. Aside
from public health, disciplines that center equity, human and civil rights, history, and sociology
are situated conceptually and physically apart in curriculum, libraries, and university campuses.
This leaves the social sciences and social justice far from scientific and technical advances with
the most urgent problems facing society as the challenging divide between. Several scholars
have contributed research and practice to formally integrate social justice ideas and areas of
STEM to critique solutions, propose curriculum, and imagine an interdisciplinary future. This talk
will explore and reframe STEM process, products, and knowledge through the lens of social
justice as a possible path toward the Beloved Community and STEM for human and social
good.

Lauren Quigley, PhD is a Research Scientist leading social impact projects at the intersection of
technology, data, and social justice. Her work aims to answer two broad questions: who gets to
be an engineer/technologist? and what good can technology do? To achieve these goals her
work focuses on identity and critical theory use in engineering education and data-centric
solutions for social justice.
Lauren has authored several peer-reviewed publications and has led international STEM
education programs in higher education and industry. Lauren earned a Bachelor of Science
degree in Physics from Spelman College, Master of Science degree in Optical Engineering from
Norfolk State University, and PhD in Engineering Education from Virginia Tech. She is currently a
Research Scientist at IBM Research in the Responsible and Inclusive Technologies group and
Affiliate Assistant Professor at the University of Washington, Department of Human Centered
Design & Engineering.
